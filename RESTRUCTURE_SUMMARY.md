# Capacitor Adyen Plugin Restructure Summary

This document summarizes the restructuring and improvements made to the Capacitor Adyen plugin for better readability, maintainability, and Android support.

## Changes Made

### 1. iOS Plugin Restructuring

#### Dead Code Removal
- Removed all references to unsupported components (DropIn, Ideal, PayPal, Bancontact)
- Cleaned up unused method declarations from `pluginMethods` array
- Removed unused event types and listeners from TypeScript definitions

#### Improved File Organization
- **Created `CardComponent.swift`**: Dedicated file for card-specific functionality
  - Encapsulates card component creation, validation, and state management
  - Provides clean API for card operations
  - Includes debugging and cleanup utilities

- **Simplified `AdyenBridge.swift`**: Now focuses on core bridge functionality
  - Uses the new `AdyenCardComponent` class
  - Maintains shared functionality across components
  - Cleaner, more readable structure

- **Streamlined `CardComponent+Bridge.swift`**: Only bridge-specific enhancements
  - Removed duplicate functionality now in `CardComponent.swift`
  - Focuses on bridge-specific configuration and validation
  - Maintains separation of concerns

- **Removed `ComponentFactory.swift`**: Functionality moved to dedicated component classes

#### Benefits
- Better separation of concerns
- Each component has its own dedicated file
- Shared functionality remains centralized
- More maintainable and testable code structure

### 2. Android Plugin Implementation

#### New Kotlin-based Implementation
- **`AdyenPlugin.kt`**: Main plugin class matching iOS functionality
- **`AdyenImplementation.kt`**: Core implementation with SDK management
- **`AdyenCardComponent.kt`**: Dedicated card component class

#### Features Implemented
- Same method signatures as iOS:
  - `setCurrentPaymentMethods`: Parses and stores payment methods from server
  - `presentCardComponent`: Creates configured card component
  - `hideComponent`: Proper component cleanup

#### Build Configuration
- Added Kotlin support to `build.gradle`
- Added Adyen Android SDK dependencies:
  - `com.adyen.checkout:card:5.7.0`
  - `com.adyen.checkout:core:5.7.0`
  - `com.adyen.checkout:drop-in:5.7.0`

#### Architecture Consistency
- Mirrors iOS structure with dedicated component files
- Same error handling patterns
- Consistent logging and debugging features

### 3. Shared Improvements

#### TypeScript Definitions
- Removed unused component methods and types
- Cleaned up event listener definitions
- Only supports Card component functionality

#### Web Interface
- Removed unused method stubs
- Consistent with new focused API

## File Structure

### iOS
```
ios/Sources/AdyenPlugin/
├── AdyenPlugin.swift                 # Main plugin class
├── Core/
│   ├── AdyenBridge.swift            # Core bridge functionality
│   ├── AdyenContext+Extensions.swift
│   ├── AdyenError.swift

    └── PaymentDataSerializer.swift
```

### Android
```
android/src/main/java/com/capacitor/community/adyen/
├── AdyenPlugin.kt                   # NEW: Main plugin class
├── AdyenImplementation.kt           # NEW: Core implementation
└── components/
    └── AdyenCardComponent.kt        # NEW: Dedicated card component
```

## Benefits of the Restructure

1. **Better Readability**: Each component has its own dedicated file with clear responsibilities
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to add new components without cluttering existing files
3. **Consistency**: Android and iOS follow the same architectural patterns
4. **Dead Code Removed**: Only Card component support as requested
5. **Focused API**: Clean interface with only supported methods
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Core functionality, component-specific code, and bridge enhancements are clearly separated

## Supported Functionality

Both iOS and Android now support:
- ✅ `setCurrentPaymentMethods`: Set payment methods from server
- ✅ `presentCardComponent`: Present card payment component
- ✅ `hideComponent`: Hide currently presented component
- ❌ Other components (DropIn, Ideal, PayPal, Bancontact) - removed as requested

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive tests for both platforms
2. Add example implementation for card component usage
3. Update documentation with new API structure
4. Consider adding more card-specific configuration options
